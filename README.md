# 📈 StockAnalysis

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **Java console-based program** that performs basic **stock price analysis** using both arrays and ArrayLists.  
It demonstrates key programming concepts such as **method overloading**, **loops**, and **collections** by calculating averages, maximums, counts, and cumulative sums of stock prices.  
The project serves as a hands-on exercise in **modular programming and data processing**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Calculate **average stock price** (supports both arrays and ArrayLists)  
- Find the **maximum stock price** using iteration  
- Count **occurrences of a target price**  
- Compute a **cumulative sum** of stock prices  
- Demonstrate **method overloading** for multiple data structures  
- Display analytical results directly in the console

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Method Overloading** | Each operation is defined for both `float[]` and `ArrayList<Float>` |
| **Arrays** | Store and process fixed-length stock data |
| **ArrayList** | Dynamic alternative for stock data handling |
| **Loops (for-each)** | Iterate through prices to perform calculations |
| **Conditional Logic** | Compare elements to find maximum or matches |
| **Encapsulation & Modularization** | Logical operations separated into reusable static methods |
| **Generics** | `ArrayList<Float>` demonstrates type-safe collections |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Average, sum, and cumulative computations |

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open a terminal in the project directory.  
2️⃣ Compile:
```bash
javac StockAnalysis.java

```

## 🏫 Educational Context

This program was created as part of a Computer Science course at the University of the People to demonstrate:

Practical applications of loops, arrays, and collections

Use of overloaded methods for flexibility

Implementation of data analysis logic in a modular, reusable structure

It provides an introductory exploration into data processing and algorithmic thinking using Java.
